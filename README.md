## decoherence_rates


# Decoehrence for two atoms
In Julia: function.jl contains the important functions used by the other jl files. 2_atoms_decoherence_rate.jl calculates the decoherence rate for two atoms at distances Delta x

In Matlab run_Dx_Dn : Photons necessary to decoehre the state for a distance Dx run_master_equation gives evolution of the state, the purity and scattering rate.
